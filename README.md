TeaECS is a simple Rust ECS. I'm building this project for learning purposes. 

This project doesn't have the ambition to be as good or better than popular ECS libraries 
such as [Legion](https://github.com/TomGillen/legion) or [Specs](https://github.com/amethyst/specs). It is however heavily inspired by them.

## Contributing
Feel free to create issues and pull requests to the project.
